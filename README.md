## Angular Webapp - Employee Dashboard ##

Simple Angular application that allows users to add "employees" to a dashboard. The user can also delete employees from the table as well as update existing ones. Some of the styles were bootstrapped while others were hard-coded. 

The styles are mobile responsive, so the application can be used on smaller mobile screens.
